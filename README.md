# Calory_Pal

CaloryPal is a web-app that helps record food and calorie intake per meal. The application is a Full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React,js, Node.js) stack project, using JWT tokenization as the method for user Authorization.


## How To Use

Open 2 terminals, one on the frontend directory and the other on the backend directory. run `npm start` on both of them.

NOTE :warning: : A `.env` file must be created with your mongoDB atlas link (MONGO_URI), the Port of your choice (PORT), a secret string that the hashing for the password would utilise when creating user token (SECRET) and a node evironment variable that helps in the production and deployment of the app (NODE_ENV=production). Unfortunately, this file is not shown or made available by me for personal secuirity reasons.
